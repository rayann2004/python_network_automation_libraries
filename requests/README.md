is README includes excerpts and information from the official Requests documentation (https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

Requests is a Python library that makes sending HTTP requests simple and elegant. 
It handles all the low-level details like connections, headers, encoding, and JSON for you.


import requests
# Send a GET request
response = requests.get("https://httpbin.org/get")
print("Status Code:", response.status_code)
print("Content-Type:", response.headers['content-type'])
print("Response JSON:", response.json())
